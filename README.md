# Introduction
Bangladesh’s rapid digital transformation necessitates a robust legal framework to address cyber threats, data privacy, and digital governance. While the Digital Security Act (DSA) 2018 and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act 2006 exist, they face criticism for being overly broad, prone to misuse, and inadequate against modern cyber risks. This proposal suggests reforms inspired by global best practices (EU’s GDPR, Singapore’s Cybersecurity Act, and India’s IT Act Amendments) to strengthen Bangladesh’s cyber legal infrastructure.

# Cyber laws in Bangladesh
1 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act, 2006
Enacted to promote and regulate ICT services, the ICT Act established cyber tribunals to adjudicate cybercrimes. However, certain provisions, particularly Section 57, faced criticism for threatening freedom of speech .

2 Digital Security Act (DSA), 2018
The DSA replaced Section 57 of the ICT Act and introduced stringent measures against cybercrimes. It allowed police to detain individuals without a warrant and was criticized for its potential to suppress free speech and press freedom .

3 Cyber Security Act (CSA), 2023
The CSA aimed to enhance digital security by addressing cybercrimes. However, it retained many provisions from the DSA, leading to continued concerns about freedom of expression .

4 Repeal and Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025
In May 2025, the interim government repealed the CSA and introduced the Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025, recognizing internet access as a civil right and abolishing controversial provisions .

#  Proposed Reforms and Global Benchmarking
## Clear Legal Definitions
Drawing from the UK's Computer Misuse Act, Bangladesh should establish precise definitions for cybercrimes to prevent misuse and ensure fair application.

##  Data Protection and Privacy
Aligning with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Bangladesh should implement comprehensive data protection laws, ensuring individuals' privacy rights are upheld.

##  Independent Oversight
Inspired by Germany's approach, Bangladesh should establish an independent cybersecurity regulatory body to oversee the implementation of cyber laws and address grievances.

##  Public Awareness and Education
Following Estonia's model, Bangladesh should invest in public awareness campaigns and integrate cybersecurity education into school curricula to foster a culture of digital responsibility.

#  Implementation Strategy
## Legislative Reforms
•	Action: Draft and enact comprehensive cybersecurity legislation that incorporates clear definitions, data protection provisions, and independent oversight mechanisms.
•	Timeline: 6–12 months
•	Responsible Entities: Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, Law Ministry
##  Capacity Building
•	Action: Establish training programs for law enforcement and judiciary on cyber laws and digital forensics.
•	Timeline: Ongoing
•	Responsible Entities: Bangladesh Police, Judicial Training Institute
##  Public Awareness Campaigns
•	Action: Launch nationwide campaigns to educate citizens about cybersecurity best practices and their rights under the new laws.
•	Timeline: 3–6 months
•	Responsible Entities: Ministry of Information, Civil Society Organizations
##  International Collaboration
•	Action: Sign and ratify the Budapest Convention to enhance international cooperation in combating cybercrime.
•	Timeline: 6–9 months
•	Responsible Entities: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology

#  Conclusion and Recommendations
Bangladesh's journey in developing cyber laws has been marked by efforts to balance digital security with individual freedoms. The repeal of the CSA and the introduction of the Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025, signify a positive shift towards recognizing internet access as a civil right. However, to build a resilient digital future, the following recommendations are crucial:
1.	Enact Comprehensive Cybersecurity Legislation: Establish clear legal definitions and robust data protection measures.
2.	Strengthen Institutional Capacity: Invest in training and resources for law enforcement and the judiciary.
3.	Promote Public Awareness: Educate citizens on cybersecurity best practices and their rights.
4.	Enhance International Cooperation: Engage in global initiatives to combat cyber threats effectively.
By adopting these measures, Bangladesh can create a legal framework that not only addresses cyber threats but also upholds democratic values and human rights in the digital realm.
